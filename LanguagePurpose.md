# **Language purpose/genesis**


### **Why was the language created?**

* **Swift:** Swift is a general-purpose programming language built using a modern approach to safety, performance, and software design patterns. The goal of the Swift project is to create the best available language for uses ranging from systems programming, to mobile and desktop apps, scaling up to cloud services. Most importantly, Swift is designed to make writing and maintaining correct programs easier for the developer.


* **Kotlin:** Kotlin was created by JetBrains. The company frequently used Java and was getting frustrated with some of its features. They saw features from other programming languages like Scala that they liked, but Scala's slow compile time prevented them from using Scala. Jetbrains decided to create Kotlin, and they wanted Kotlin to be compatible with Java so they did not need to rewrite applications that they had written in Java. Kotlin is more concice than Java, and it is estimated that Kotlin code can be 40% shorter than the same code written in Java. Kotlin also supports non-nullable types, which prevents null pointer exceptions.

### **What problems was the language trying to address?**


* **Swift:** 
Currently both major Apple platforms rely on the Cocoa API, but the programming language which is attached to Cocoa is Objective C. A language which was a sound pragmatic choice for NeXT more than three decades ago. Swift is a more modern language that can still be used with Cocoa. Swift also imporves upon many aspects of Objective C including using optionals, tye inference and allowing functional programming. Swift is also faster, easier to read and code will be more concise. 


* **Kotlin:** Kotlin is trying to address several problems with Java including null safety, shorter syntax, support for functional programming, better comparison operators. 


### **Is the language a reaction to a previous language or a replacement for another language?**
* **Swift:** Swift is a reaction to Objective C. Swift made many improvements such as: 


|Some Aspects of Objective C that Swift improves:                      |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|Swift runs faster                                                     |
|Swift is easier to read and easier to learn than Objective-C          |
|No pointers means Swift is ‘safer.’                                   |
|Better memory management.                                             |
|Swift has type inference                                              |

* **Kotlin:** Kotlin is a reaction to Java. It improves upon many aspects of Java


|Some Aspects of Java that Kotlin improves:                            |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|Null references are controlled by the type system                     |
|No raw types                                                          |
|Arrays in Kotlin are invariant                                        |
|Kotlin has proper function types, as opposed to Java's SAM-conversions|
|Use-site variance without wildcards                                   |
|Kotlin does not have checked exceptions                               |
