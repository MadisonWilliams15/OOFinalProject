# Inheritance and Extension

## Swift
Classes in Swift can call and access methods, properties, and subscripts belonging to their superclass and can provide their own overriding versions of those methods, properties, and subscripts to refine or modify their behavior. Swift helps to ensure your overrides are correct by checking that the override definition has a matching superclass definition.

Classes can also add property observers to inherited properties in order to be notified when the value of a property changes. Property observers can be added to any property, regardless of whether it was originally defined as a stored or computed property.
## Kotlin
All classes in Kotlin have a common superclass Any, that is the default superclass for a class with no supertypes declared:

```Kotlin
class Example // Implicitly inherits from Any
```
Code in a derived class can call its superclass functions and property accessors implementations using the super keyword:

```Kotlin
open class Foo {
    open fun f() { println("Foo.f()") }
    open val x: Int get() = 1
}

class Bar : Foo() {
    override fun f() { 
        super.f()
        println("Bar.f()") 
    }
    
    override val x: Int get() = super.x + 1
}
```
